Two powerful techniques in stimulating language development;

#### Self Talk

Talking about what you're doing yourself.

> I'm putting on my shoes.

#### Parallel Talk

Talk in parallel with whatever the child is focussing on; provide the language that matches the child's environment.

> Oh, you're scratching your head!

These techniques are HARD to implement due to [pragmatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatics); just imagine talking to an adult; "I'm coming in through the door. I see you're sitting down!"

Instead, we bombard children with questions (as we normally would with adults); we need to suppress this urge. Bombard kids with content, not questions.

Child Directed Speech (slower talking) is good, but Baby Talk (using silly grammar) is not helpful.

#### Reading Books

It's constructive to read the same book for a week to reinforce the language in the book. The reading itself isn't the main value; the language and talking is the benefit. A variety (basic letter books, simple story books and more grown up novels).

#### Screen Time

Even educational/content-based TV programmes do not do a good job of teaching vocabulary. Screen time detracts from face-to-face time.
