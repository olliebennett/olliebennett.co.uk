HomePicker (catchy name, I know!) helps people collaborate on their property search
by building a shortlist of homes together.

- Quickly pull in listing details from [Zoopla](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/) or [Rightmove](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/).
- Share comments or ratings to discover what each of you like.
- Find the place you all fall in love with!

I built this for my own house move, to collect, rate and discuss homes with my wife and wider family.
