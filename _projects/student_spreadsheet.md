Initially arising from the need to simplify the splitting of receipts with housemates at uni, this bill sharing utility allows tracking costs, calculating how much you owe, and notifying your housemates to pay you back!

Convenient auto-consolidation and cancelling off who owes who, avoids the need for making niggly little payments.

Having been iterated and proven between my housemates and friends, I opened it up via Facebook login and got modest traction.

It became a driving force in me joining Splittable (then acasa) to build out their broader vision for housesharing and payments.
