Calculating your degree or course progress can be tricky.

This tool calculates the weighted results of course credits across the different modules and years of a university course.

For a bit of motivation (or perhaps to help you slack off!), it'll also pump out an indication of what you need to achieve to hit your target grade.

The project was built during an evening spent *working out* how hard we should be working, instead of actually working!
