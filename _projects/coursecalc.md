This tool helps calculate the varied weightings of course credits across the different modules and years of a university course.

Calculating your degree or course progress can course can be tricky. This tool take your grades (and weightings) for your modules so far, and calculates which grade you're headed for. For a bit of motivation (or perhaps to help you slack off!), it'll also pump out an indication of what you need to achieve to hit your target grade.

This was the output of an evening spent working out how hard we should be working (instead of working hard)!
