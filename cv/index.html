<h2>Experience</h2>

<article>
	
  <h3>Technical&nbsp;Consultant / HP&nbsp;Autonomy / July&nbsp;2012&nbsp;-&nbsp;Present</h3>
  
  <!--
  <p>Worked as a client-facing representative of HP, providing high value services through creation and delivery of heavily customised enterprise software. Serviced high-profile clients in a range of fields, involving extended periods at client sites in Europe, often as the sole consultant on high-pressure "red" projects. Through liaison with Engineering and Support teams, product issues were effectively delivered, whilst also managing the client's expectations. Product customisation ranged from configuration changes and performance tuning to implementation of complex logic, in order to route trade confirmation documents for some of Europe's largest banks. Also helped craft an entirely new offering based on pre-existing products, to serve the requirements of a special operations law enforcement agency.</p>

  <p class="punchline">A client-facing post-sales consultant providing high value services through heavy customisation and delivery of enterprise software.</p>
  
  <ul>

	<li>Development of extensive customised logic for banks' post-trade documentation management, requiring a highly-performant and failure-resistant Java/J2EE application. Also controlled server configuration and integration with upstream systems. Extensive front-end design using modern technologies while ensuring back-compatibility with client's legacy browsers.</li>
	<li>Helped develop new software offering for HP, following requirement capturing from a law enforcement agency. Integrated third-party facial-recognition software and a heavily tailored HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface into a pre-existing content management offering.</li>
	
	<li>Joined several high-pressure projects, visiting clients to manage expectations while liasing with Engineering and Support teams to effectively resolve product issues. Restored positive relationships through flexibility and willingness to assist wherever possible (as was reflected by very positive feedback from clients post go-live).</li>
	<li>Worked with several highly experienced external Java consultants to gain substantial "best-practice" knowledge of development. Inherited responsibility after their contracts ended.</li>
	<li>Created and shared time-saving scripts/tools for automating builds and deployments during off-site development, as well as proposing project tracking and collaboration tools to management which were subsequently adopted.</li>
	<li>Oversaw critical migrations and go-live events (often outside the UK, and outside working hours), reacting fast to issues and identifying resolutions or workarounds in the absence of support.</li>

  <h3>Master's Dissertation / University of Nottingham / 2011</h3>

  <p class="punchline">Quantum Reflection of Ultra-Cold Atoms from Room Temperature Silicon</p>

  <p>This project involved computationally analysing quantum mechanical phenomena, through modelling the reflection of ultra-cold groups of atom as they approached a surface. I repeatedly improved the methods implemented in MATLAB and C++, such that more accurate representations could be made. The resulting project was "one of the best" the supervisor had seen.</p>
